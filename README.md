# üé¨ IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

## üìñ Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on IMDb movie reviews using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** based neural network. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative sentiment.

The model is trained to classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**. With the rise of user-generated content and online reviews, sentiment analysis has become an essential tool for businesses and platforms that want to monitor public opinion and feedback at scale. In this project, we specifically work with the IMDb dataset, which contains real movie reviews submitted by users.

This implementation leverages deep learning techniques to capture the sequential nature of text data and learn context-based patterns that are important for sentiment classification. The project is well-suited for beginners and intermediate learners looking to apply LSTM in a real-world NLP task.
